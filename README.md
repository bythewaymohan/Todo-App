# Todo-App
## React To-Do Application

This project is a simple To-Do application built using ReactJS and Redux. It allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and toggle the completion status of tasks. The tasks are also persisted in local storage, so they are not lost on page reload.

## Features

1. **Add Task**: Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or the Enter key.
2. **View Tasks**: All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
3. **Edit Task**: Tasks can be edited after being added.
4. **Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
5. **Mark Task as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed without being deleted, and completed tasks are visually indicated with a strikethrough.
6. **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to local storage and reloaded when the app initializes.
7. **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks to show all, completed, or uncompleted tasks.
